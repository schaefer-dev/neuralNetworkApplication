# EX 1:
- Q1.4: Incorrect approach (-1 point)
- Q2.3: Incorrect mean (-1 point)
- Q2.4: No solution submitted (-2 point)

# EX 2:
- -1 for error in calculations in 2.1 
- -0.5 for comment in c, it is expected that the points be on one line. 
- -1 for 2.2b What causes the underflow then? 
- -2 for 2.3b (missing) 
- -0.5 for 2.4, Newton's method converges in one step, this should happen in your code, but since you have epsilon as 1, you only lose 0.5 a point

# EX 3:
- 3.1.c update rule for weights not provided (-2 points)
- 3.1.g incomplete (-2)
- 3.1.h,i (-4)
- 3.2 (-3)

# EX 4:
- Q 4.2: Numerical error while computing lambda (-0.5 pt)

# EX 5:
- 5.1: No submission (-3 pts)
- 5.2: The plot is different from what was expected. The code for forward-pass seems fine, I'm unable to debug the back-propagation section. (-7 pts)

# EX 6:
- 6.1b: (-1 pt) 
- 6.3b,c: No solution submitted(-4 pt) 
- 6.4c,d,e: No solution submitted(-9 pts) 
- Bonus: (-1 pt) 

# EX 7:
- 7.2.e Incorrect analytical solution (-2 pts)
- 7.3.c Plots not clear (-1 pt)

# EX 8:
- 8.4: Error message while executing the program (-2 pts)

# EX 9:
- 15 points
